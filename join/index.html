            <h1>Join Galaktisk</h1>
            <p>As Galaktisk is manually run, you must use this form to request your site to be added.<br>Feel free to email or message on discord to speed up the process.</p>
            
            <a href="https://forms.gle/ChUv3SaNBUKVC5wX9"><button>Join</button></a>
            
            <p>You don't have to code your own site! Let us do the heavy lifting for you. Use this website to generate a Galaktisk page in the theme of MySpace generated with your information</p>
            <a href="/pagebuilder/"><button>Build my page</button></a>

            <h2>How do I host my site?</h2>
            <p>We suggest using neocities.org, but you can use any host you'd like.<br><br>For neocities, go to neocities.org and make an account.<br>Once you've created an account, go to neocities.org/dashboard, this will be the root of your webpage.</p>
            <h2>What do I need to put in my root? (applies to all hosts)</h2>
            <p>Place a square page picture named icon.png in the root of your page - this will be used for your page if you used the page builder & it will be used for the Galaktisk browse page</p>
            <p>If you used the page builder, place the index.html file that was downloaded when you generated your code into the root of your page</p>
            <h2>How can I get this on the Galaktisk browser?</h2>
            <p>As of now, fill out the google form (press the Join button at the top) with your name, link and a form of contact (e.g: email, discord username) and your site will be posted when it's seen.</p>
